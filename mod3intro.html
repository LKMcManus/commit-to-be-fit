					<h1>Cardio & Low Cal or Strength & Low Carb</h1>
					<p> 
						Cardio training and a low calorie, low fat, diet helps burn calories quickly.  For those who get snacking cravings throughout the day (or struggle with blood sugar) eating more often is important.  In order to do that you can eat low fat foods and take your overall calories planned for the day and divide it over the amount of times you like to eat.  Eating more often throughout the day keeps your body burning calories throughout the day.  Breaking down food burns calories and the less fat you eat the more your body will pull from stored fat when fats are needed.  Remember carbs burn fast and you can feel hungry more quickly if you eat just breads or sugars for one of the meals.  Since you Cardio workouts tend to focus on burning energy through doing highly repetitive movements with little resistance, like walking, running, biking swimming.  If you would prefer to go for a three mile walk over doing 50 pushups then cardio work outs will probably be something you are more likely to stick with.  Most people prefer Cardio exercises since the techniques are simple and seem easier to plan.  Choose this program if you feel you need to snack more throughout the day and the exercise you would prefer to do is low resistance exercises.<br/>

						Strength training and a low carb diet can be an alternative lifestyle choice to lose weight.  Remember to lose two pounds a week we have to burn more calories than we consume.  Strength training not only gets you to move more and burn calories but the more muscle mass you have the more calories you burn even at rest.  Strength training creates lean muscle mass.  As we age we tend to lose 2 to 3 percent of our resting metabolic rate which is typically due to the loss of lean muscle.  So Strength training actually becomes more important the older you get.  Low carb lifestyle creates an environment in your body that leads to weight loss.  Our muscles need the glycogen in carbs to move and as long as our glycogen stores in our muscles are being refueled through the carbs we eat your body will not break down the stored fat in your body.  So eating only high fiber carbs found in vegetables and some fruits keeps your glycogen stores low and creates a fat burning body.  Second Eating protein takes more effort for the body to breakdown and therefore you tend to sustain your hunger longer.  People who struggle with not feeling full can utilize this plan to their advantage to avoid cravings.  Choose this program if you find strength training more fun than cardio and want meat and high fiber vegetables to be the majority of what you eat.<br/>
