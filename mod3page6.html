					<p>With strength training there are several key foundations to be aware of for your safety.  
					<ul>
						<li>Control the weight- Use a one second count to lift/pull/push the weight and returning the weight to the rest position do slowly and controlled at a three count. </li>
						<li>Breathe- Ideally exhale during the lift and inhale during the return motion.</li>
						<li>Go until you fail- The weights you chose should result in your body barely able to complete the final rep of a set.  If you go to failure this increases your strength and muscle gains.</li>
						<li>Focus on form- Research the correct form of the exercise.  When you break form that should count as a failure for the rep.  So if you are having to break form too early in your set, lower the weight.</li>
						<li>Include variation- Strength training can get boring quickly, so research several different exercises that work the same muscle groups and switch to those each week.   A lot of strength training can be accomplished just using your body weight</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>When starting out our goal is 4 sets with 8-12 reps.  This means you will be a starting with a lighter weight.  The more comfortable you get with form and the weight over the time the more weight you can add on and the less reps you will have to do.  But for now start with a weight that allows you to go to failure after 4 sets and 8-12 reps.
					<ul>
						<li>Start with low weight and work up.  If after the first set you find it very easy add weight for the second set and so on. Remember as yourself "Can I do 4 sets at 8-12 reps?" and then adjust as needed.</li>
						<li>Keep a notebook with you and mark down the weight sets and reps after each exercise completion</li>
						<li>Don't stay with the same weight and reps for to long.  Every two weeks if doing strength training three times a week increase your weight</li>
						<li>Remember when you increase your weight you might have to decrease reps or sets but always stay in control and in form</li>
						<li>If you find yourself having to sacrifice form to get the weight up, lower the weights back down</li>				</ul>
					</p>

								Strength training is a great way to start losing that fat weight.  Some safety precautions are important to review.  Assessments for your strength should be as close to the exercises you want to perform and be sure you are choosing exercises that uses the major muscle groups of your body.  
								
								Hiring a strength trainer each week for your program might not be in your budget but you can schedule a one time assessment with a personal trainer so they can walk you through your baseline strength and what a good set/rep starting point could be and what your next goal should be.
