								Remember the plan, Eat Less Move More, Get Help!  Losing stored fat comes down to simple math.  You have to take in less calories than you burn.  But what is a calorie?  To avoid a lot of academic jargon let us simplify what a calorie is.  A calorie is a way to measure energy.  So we take in energy when we consume food.  There are two ways to make sure you burn more calories than you eat: eat less and move more.  You have been told that exercise helps you lose weight, time to understand how. Your body without exercise does burn some of this energy by maintaining your body temperature and just keeping your internal organs functioning. This is known as your resting metabolic rate. Strength training exploits your resting metabolic rate.  Not only do you burn calories while you are working out but the more muscle mass you have on your body the higher your resting metabolic rate is.   Your muscles are powerhouses for burning energy and cardiovascular work gets those muscles moving fast and hard.  Since your muscles need oxygen to help make and expend energy your lungs work to bring in more oxygen and your heart pumps that oxygen to your muscles.  This increases your body temperature and causes even more energy to be burned.  Exercise that not only burns up the energy we consume but starts to burn our stored energy (fat) helps lose fat weight.  
								With all the great benefits of moving more the absolute quickest way to create that calorie deficit is by eating less.  Portion control and limiting foods high in sugar will help you restrict calories that come into your body.  Here is a great quick reference on portion size and corresponding calories.
