								Heart Disease and strokes are the #1 and #3 causes of death respectively so we better take our heart and lung health seriously.  The foods we eat play into our heart and cardiovascular health with cholesterol.  Cholesterol is a soft substance found in the blood.  We produce cholesterol naturally but we often eat cholesterol as well.  Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)is rich in fat and low in protein and does not travel down the blood stream nicely. It is more likely to create micro-tears in our vascular system which leads to calcification and eventually blockages.  That is why LDL-C is known as “bad” cholesterol.  HDL-C or High-density lipoprotein cholesterol is known as the good cholesterol because it acts like a trash truck in your blood and picks up the LDL to carry it to the liver where it is broken apart and eliminated from the body.  When fat or triglycerides (TGs) are in the blood in high amounts this decreases HDL Good and increases Bad LDL cholesterol.  An easy way to think about it is the L of LDL should stand for low. Which is why Cardio vascular exercise is so great to help avoid heart disease.  Cardio decreases the TC found in the blood, increases Your good HDL and helps change the size of LDL leading to less micro tears in your arteries and veins.  These benefits are seen with the greatest improvement in people who are overweight and begin to lose fat by eating less and moving more.

							<p>A quick note on smoking.  If you smoke, you need to stop.  The long term effects of smoking not only destroy your lungs but also weaken your arteries and veins making them more susceptible to micro tares.  Smoking is simply poison to your body.  Eating less and moving more might help you lose weight even if you are smoking but your overall health will suffer and will lead to an early death.
